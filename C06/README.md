# Functions

- Function Declarations
- 


---
## Some EXP

- The general form of a function definition:
```c
return_type function_name( parameter list )
{
body of the function
}
```

**the declaration of the function**

```c
int max(int num1, int num2);
```
Parameter names are not important in function declaration, only their type is
required, so the following is also a valid declaration:

```c
int max(int, int);
```
- the `const` keyword in functions it's important in some cases ```int Func_a(const type);```
