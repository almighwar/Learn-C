# Pointer


---

## Some EXP

```c
PointerType *PointerName;
//          ^
// The multiplier operator, this is what differentiates a pointer from a variable
```
- pointer types is the same variable types `int`, `float`, `char`, `unsigned`, `signed`, `short`, `long`, `etc...`
- the condition to named a pointer is same as variable:
   - only 31 characters
   - doesn't start with numbers
   - don't write operators like plus, minus, dived, multiplied
   - doesn't have a symbols {@#$%...} except `_`
   - don't use the same pointer name 2 times
   - don't use the keywords as name
- we don't give a value to pointer directly.
