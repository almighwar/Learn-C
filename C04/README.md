# Control statements

## Repeated Loops

- switch
- while
- do while
- for

---

## Some EXP

- `switch` function and `case`, `break`, `default` 
  - `switch` is like `if..else` but sometimes it's better than `if` function 
  - `break` come with `case` and it's important, Without it, things go wrong 
  - `default` is semi-like `else`, if the other cases are false, will be implemented

**while and do...while**
