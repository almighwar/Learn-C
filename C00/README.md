In this step you know what you have to do, you can use a simple editor like vim, emacs, nano, micro, notepad, gedit, Featherpad, Subleme Text, or whatever editor you like..

install the compiler "manualy" such as `gcc or Clang`[^1] , borland turbo C/C++, tiny C, Portable C (CPP).
ofc if you wanna install an editor with compiler there's a IDE like Visual C++ or DEV-C++ or Turbo C or Codeblocks with compiler and it's available on linux and windows or editor support the language such as Visual Studio.


[^1]: i know them but the rest i never use them
