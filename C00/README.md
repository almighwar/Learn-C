In this step you know what you have to do, you can use a simple editor like vim, emacs, nano, micro, notepad, gedit, Featherpad, Subleme Text, or whatever editor you like..

install the compiler "manualy" such as `gcc or Clang`[^1] , borland turbo C/C++, tiny C, Portable C (CPP).
ofc if you wanna install an editor with compiler there's an IDEs such as Visual C++, DEV-C++, Turbo C, Codeblocks with compiler which is available on linux and windows, or a editor language-supported such as Visual Studio, Subleme Text.
